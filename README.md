# Linux Toolbox

Linux Toolbox(formely LTB) is yet another toolbox app,
meant to be fast, reliable, and easy to use!


## How this can be useful?

So, you want an example? OK, there we go...  
Imagine this scenario, your distro isn't booting anymore,
everything you want is reach desktop again, right?, LTB can help you
with this, and a lot more!



## Differentials

- Really easy to use (it gets ridiculous lmao)
- Will work on a big variety of distros
- Features an rich, beautiful and customizable UI
- Has an help page, explaining how every command works


## How can i use this toolbox?

In order to make this toolbox work properly, you need to have
Python installed in your distro, it's on Alpha stage anyways,
you'll have a lot of bugs.


    
## FAQ

### When custom downloader will be enabled?

We really don't have an ETA, as this is an hobby project,
made just for fun, so, we're sorry, but we don't know.



### Why make another Linux toolbox when there too many of them?

These toolbox are difficult to use, lack tools, and isn't
really too much useful, we're aiming to do anything unique,
easy, useful and powerful :)

### Where are my data stored?

Your data (e.g: logs, distro info and +) are stored in your PC, 
we don't collect any data, this project isn't even complex enough
to send any data to us, you're safe using this toolbox! Yay!

### When LTB will be released?

It's an hobby project, we're loving to code this, for now,
we can't expect any ETA.

### What development stage is LTB on?

Probably Alpha, it's on the initial stages, but we're working
hard on this little thing!
